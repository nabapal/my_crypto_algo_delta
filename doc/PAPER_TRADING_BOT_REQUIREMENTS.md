# Paper Trading Bot Requirements & Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for building a paper trading bot that implements the EMA+ATR strategy with Delta Exchange integration. The bot should provide detailed logging, error tracking, and performance analysis capabilities.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Data Feed Module
Since `data_feed.py` was deleted, we need to recreate a robust data feed system:

**Required Features:**
- Historical 1H candle data fetching for strategy calculations
- Live price data for stop-loss and take-profit execution
- Delta Exchange API integration using official `delta-rest-client`
- Data validation and error handling
- Automatic retry mechanism for API failures

**Implementation:**
```python
class DataFeed:
    - fetch_historical_candles(symbol, count=100)  # For EMA/ATR calculation
    - fetch_live_price(symbol)                     # For real-time SL/TP checks
    - validate_data(data)                          # Data quality checks
    - handle_api_errors()                          # Robust error handling
```

### 2. Paper Trading Engine
A comprehensive trading simulation engine that:

**Position Management:**
- Tracks open positions with entry price, quantity, stop-loss, take-profit
- Implements trailing stop-loss functionality
- Handles position sizing based on risk management rules
- Maintains portfolio balance and P&L calculations

**Order Execution Simulation:**
- Simulates market orders at current live price
- Processes stop-loss and take-profit orders
- Handles slippage simulation (optional)
- Tracks execution timestamps and prices

### 3. Strategy Integration
Integration with the existing EMA+ATR strategy:

**Strategy Execution:**
- Monitor 1H candles for entry signals (EMA crossover + ATR confirmation)
- Calculate swing high/low for stop-loss placement
- Implement risk-reward ratio validation (10:1 as per config)
- Support for multiple strategy versions (v1, v2, v3)

**Signal Generation:**
- Real-time signal detection on new 1H candle close
- Entry condition validation (bullish/bearish crossover)
- Exit condition monitoring (stop-loss, take-profit, trailing stop)

### 4. Logging & Monitoring System

#### 4.1 API Communication Logs
**File:** `logs/api_communication_YYYYMMDD.log`
**Content:**
- All API requests and responses
- Response times and status codes
- Rate limiting information

- Portfolio balance updates
- Risk management calculations

#### 4.3 Market Data Logs
**File:** `logs/market_data_YYYYMMDD.log`
**Content:**
- 1H candle data with timestamps
- EMA9, EMA20, and ATR values

- Live price updates for SL/TP monitoring

#### 4.4 Error & Exception Logs
**File:** `logs/errors_YYYYMMDD.log`
**Content:**
- All exceptions and stack traces
- Data validation failures
- API connection issues
- Strategy logic errors

### 5. Comprehensive Reporting

#### 5.1 Real-time Trading Report
**File:** `reports/trades_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
**Columns:**
```csv
Timestamp,Signal_Type,Entry_Price,Stop_Loss,Take_Profit,Quantity,Risk_Amount,Expected_Reward,Position_Size_USD,Strategy_Version,EMA9,EMA20,ATR,Swing_Low,Swing_High,Portfolio_Balance
```

#### 5.2 Performance Metrics Report
**File:** `reports/performance_summary_YYYYMMDD.csv`
**Metrics:**
- Total trades executed
- Win rate percentage
- Average profit/loss per trade
- Maximum drawdown
- Sharpe ratio
- Risk-adjusted returns
- Strategy condition validation stats

#### 5.3 Strategy Validation Report
**File:** `reports/strategy_validation_YYYYMMDD.csv`
**Content:**
- Entry condition verification (EMA crossover confirmed)
- Risk-reward ratio adherence
- Stop-loss placement accuracy
- Trailing stop-loss performance
- Signal quality assessment

### 6. Configuration Management

#### 6.1 Enhanced Config Parameters
```python
# Paper Trading Specific
PAPER_TRADING_ENABLED = True
SIMULATION_MODE = True
LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
REPORT_GENERATION_INTERVAL = "1H"  # Generate reports every hour

# Risk Management
MAX_CONCURRENT_POSITIONS = 1
EMERGENCY_STOP_LOSS = 0.05  # 5% portfolio stop-loss
DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT = 0.10     # 10% daily loss limit

# Monitoring
CANDLE_MONITORING_INTERVAL = 60    # Check for new candles every 60 seconds
PRICE_MONITORING_INTERVAL = 5      # Check live price every 5 seconds
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 300           # System health check every 5 minutes
```

### 7. Error Handling & Recovery

#### 7.1 API Error Handling
- Connection timeout recovery
- Rate limit respect and backoff
- Invalid data handling
- Authentication error recovery

#### 7.2 Strategy Error Handling
- Missing indicator data handling
- Invalid signal detection
- Position sizing errors
- Portfolio balance validation

#### 7.3 System Recovery
- Automatic restart on critical errors
- State persistence between restarts
- Position recovery from logs
- Data integrity checks

### 8. Monitoring & Alerting

#### 8.1 Health Checks
- API connectivity status
- Data freshness validation
- Strategy performance monitoring
- System resource usage

#### 8.2 Performance Tracking
- Real-time P&L updates
